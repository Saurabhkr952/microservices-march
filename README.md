3. Watch the webinar ["Architecting Kubernetes Clusters for High-Traffic Websites"](https://youtu.be/t_CiHcKE-dc) for a high-level overview on the basics of Kubernetes infrastructure and traffic management, including node pools and node instances, NodePort vs LoadBalancer vs Ingress, a look at the Ingress controller landscape, and what you need to know about the Kubernetes Gateway API.

3. Watch the webinar ["Exposing APIs in Kubernetes"](https://youtu.be/g-52agV8fFw) for a high-level overview on the flow of a packet, more on NodePort vs LoadBalancer vs Ingress, Routing Internal vs external traffic (multiple ingresses, IngressClasses), Authorization and Authentication (OIDC), Rate limiting, and Graceful shutdown in Kubernetes.
